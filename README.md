# RealTimeTemperatureMonitoringSystem
The primary objective of this project is to develop a system that can effectively monitor and analyze temperature data from various devices located in different geographical areas. I will be sharing some data generation code and sample dataset that you can use to simulate real-time temperature readings for testing and development purposes.
